To create a road lane line detection program using AI, you'll need programming skills and access to suitable libraries or frameworks. Here's a step-by-step guide using Python and OpenCV, a popular computer vision library:

1. **Set up the Environment**: 
Install Python and the required libraries. You'll need OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib. You can use the following command to install them via pip:
```python
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

2. **Load and Preprocess the Image**: Read the input image and apply any necessary preprocessing steps. Common preprocessing techniques include resizing the image, converting it to grayscale, and noise reduction.

3. **Detect Lane Lines**: Apply computer vision techniques to detect lane lines in the preprocessed image. Here's a basic approach using OpenCV:
   - Apply a Gaussian blur to the image to reduce noise.
   - Convert the image to grayscale.
   - Apply Canny edge detection to identify potential edges.
   - Use a region of interest (ROI) mask to isolate the relevant area containing the road.
   - Apply the Hough Transform to detect lines within the ROI.
   - Filter and average the detected lines to obtain the left and right lane lines.

4. **Visualize and Output**: Draw the detected lane lines on the original image to visualize the results. You can use OpenCV functions like `cv2.line()` to draw the lines.

5. **Iterate and Optimize**: Experiment with different parameters and techniques to improve the accuracy of lane detection. This may involve adjusting the Gaussian blur kernel size, Canny edge detection thresholds, or Hough Transform parameters. Fine-tune these parameters until you achieve satisfactory results.

6. **Video Stream Processing**: Extend your program to process video streams instead of individual images. Capture frames from a video source, apply the lane detection algorithm to each frame, and display the results in real-time.

Remember, this is a simplified outline to get you started. Lane detection is a complex task, and there are more advanced techniques you can explore, such as deep learning-based approaches. Additionally, it's crucial to experiment, iterate, and refine your program based on real-world scenarios and feedback.
